    "intro": "IsoplotR is an R package for geochronology that was designed to be free, flexible and future-proof. The package was named after (but is not based on) Ken Ludwig's popular Isoplot add-in to Microsoft Excel. It implements functions for U-Pb, Pb-Pb, Th-Pb, <sup>40</sup>Ar/<sup>39</sup>Ar, K-Ca, Rb-Sr, Sm-Nd, Lu-Hf, Re-Os, U-Th-He, fission track and U-series disequilibrium dating as well as detrital geochronology. <p></p>This website provides easy to use point-and-click access to IsoplotR's most commonly used functions (see the <a href='#' onclick='$.tutorial();'>TUTORIAL</a> for details). Alternatively, the same functions (and more) can also be accessed from the command-line through the IsoplotR package on <a href='https://cran.r-project.org/package=IsoplotR'>CRAN</a> and <a href='https://github.com/pvermees/IsoplotR/'>GitHub</a>.\t<p></p>IsoplotR is currently available in English, Chinese and Spanish (under construction). Translation errors can be fixed <a href='http://lgc.es.ucl.ac.uk/weblate/projects/isoplotrgui/#languages'>here</a>. If you would like to help translate the software into other languages (Russian, Arabic, Welsh?), then please contact p.vermeesch[at]ucl.ac.uk. Bug reports and feature requests should be sent to the same email address.<p></p>",

The prominence of individual age components is proportional to the steepness of the CAD. This is different from probability density estimates such as histograms, in which such components stand out as peaks. It is arguably easier to identify peaks than inflection points and this probably why CADs are not as widely used as probability density estimates.

Alternatively, kernel density estimates KDEs (Vermeesch, 2012) smooth data by applying a (Gaussian) kernel:  <p></p>KDE(t) = &sum;<sub>i</sub><i>N</i> (t | &mu;=t<sub>i</sub>, &sigma;=h[t]) <span class='alignright'>(eq. 1)</span> <p></p>where <i>N</i>(&mu;,&sigma;) is the probability of observing a value t under a Normal distribution with mean &mu; and standard deviation &sigma;. h[t] is the smoothing parameter or 'bandwidth' of the kernel density estimate which may or may not depend on the age t. If h[t] depends on t, then KDE(t) is known as an 'adaptive' KDE. The default bandwidth used by <tt>IsoplotR</tt> is calculated using the algorithm of Botev et al. (2010) and modulated by the adaptive smoothing approach of Abramson (1982). The rationale behind adaptive kernel density estimation is to use a narrower bandwidth near the peaks of the sampling distribution (where the ordered dates are closely spaced in time), and a wider bandwidth in the distribution's sparsely sampled troughs. Thus, the resolution of the density estimate is optimised according to data availability. Kernel density estimates are not to be confused with <tt>Isoplot</tt>'s 'probability density plots' (PDPs). The mathematical definition of a PDP closely resembles that of the KDE, the only difference being the substitution of the bandwidth h[t] by the analytical uncertainty s[t<sub>i</sub>] in Equation 1. This similarity in appearance and definition is the source of much confusion. PDPs do not stand up to further statistical scrutiny (see counter-examples provided by Vermeesch, 2012), and are not implemented in <tt>IsoplotR</tt>.",

    "MDS_intro": "Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) is a dimension-reducting technique that takes a matrix of pairwise 'dissimilarities' between objects (e.g., detrital age distributions) as input and produces a configuration of two (or higher-) coordinates as output, so that the Euclidean distance between these coordinates approximates the dissimilarities of the input matrix. Thus, an MDS-configuration serves as a 'map' in which similar samples cluster closely together and dissimilar samples plot far apart. In the context of detrital geochronology, the dissimilarity between samples is given by the statistical distance between age distributions. There are many ways to define this statistical distance. <tt>IsoplotR</tt> uses the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) statistic for this purpose due to its simplicity and the fact that it behaves like a true distance in the mathematical sense of the word (Vermeesch, 2013, 2018). The KS-distance is closely related to the CAD-plot. It is given by the maximum vertical distance between two CAD step functions. Thus, the KS-distance takes on values between zero (perfect match between two age distributions) and one (no overlap between two distributions). Calculating the KS-distance between samples two at a time populates a symmetric dissimilarity matrix with positive values and a zero diagonal. <tt>IsoplotR</tt> implements two algorithms to convert this matrix into a configuration. The first ('classical' MDS) approach uses a sequence of basic matrix manipulations to achieve a linear fit between the KS-distances and the fittted distances on the MDS configuration. The second, more sophisticated ('nonmetric' MDS) approach subjects the input distances to a transformation f prior to fitting a configuration:<p></p>&delta;<sub>i,j</sub> = f(KS<sub>i,j</sub>)<p></p>where KS<sub>i,j</sub> is the KS-distance between samples i and j (for 1 &le; i &ne; j &le; n) and &delta;<sub>i,j</sub> is the 'disparity'. Fitting an MDS configuration then involves finding the disparity transformation that maximises the goodness of fit (or minimises the 'stress') between the disparities and the fitted distances. The latter two quantities can also be plotted against each other as a 'Shepard plot'. Additional options and higher order alternatives to these MDS algorithms are provided in a separate <tt>R</tt>-package called <a href='http://provenance-london-geochron.com'>provenance</a> (Vermeesch et al., 2016).",

For example, if z<sub>i</sub> = log(t<sub>i</sub>) then &sigma;(z<sub>i</sub>) = &sigma;(t<sub>i</sub>)∕t<sub>i</sub>. z<sub>o</sub> is a convenient central value such as the weighted mean. The slope of a line connecting the origin (x=0,y=0) of a radial plot with a data point (x<sub>i</sub>,y<sub>i</sub>) equals z<sub>i</sub>, and the horizontal distance along x-axis is a measure if its precision. Thus, the radial plot simultaneously visualises a measurement’s value and precision. No other graphical method achieves this goal with the same elegance (Galbraith, 1988). This makes the radial plot the method of choice for visualising heteroscedastic data, i.e. data with variable measurement uncertainties.
